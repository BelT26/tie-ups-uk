##Motivation
After being furloughed during the pandemic, a friend of mine has begun importing and selling eco-friendly belts produced by her brother's company in Italy:  
[tie-ups Italian site](https://www.tie-ups.it/?v=1471e3d26b3e)
As the company site is in Italian only and includes merchandise not stocked by my friend, to help her promote the products I offered to create a  different website for her for the UK market that focused on her key ranges of accessories.

##Branding
I retained the white text on a blackground of the original site header for maximum contrast.  I created a new logo using the MuseoModerno font from Google Fonts and the ribbon icon from Font Awesome.
To indicate the active page and clickable links throughout the site I used the color 'darkgoldenrod' which complements the main image on the homepage and reflects the idea of a luxury range. 

##Home Page
I wanted to maximize the visual impact on the user by including a couple of striking images of the belts themselves.
The photographs were taken by a professional photographer Tony Cullinane [Tony Cullinane Photography - Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TonyCullinanePhotography) 
The text reprents the company ethos of producing sustainable, cruelty free, stylish Italian accessories.

##Footer
To prevent overlapping on smaller devices I added a media query change the display of the company logo to 'none' so that only the clickable social media links are visible.
The links currently take the user to the Facebook and Instagram home pages. These will be amended to link directly to my friend's social media accounts in the future.
