##Motivation
After being furloughed during the pandemic, a friend of mine has begun importing and selling fashion accessories produced by her brother's company in Italy:  
[tie-ups Italian site](https://www.tie-ups.it/?v=1471e3d26b3e)
As the company site is in Italian only and includes merchandise not stocked by my friend, to help her promote the products I offered to create a website for her for the UK market that focused on her key ranges of accessories.

##Branding
I retained the white text on a blackground of the original site header for maximum contrast.  I created a new logo using the MuseoModerno font from Google Fonts and the ribbon icon from Font Awesome.
To indicate the active page and clickable links throughout the site I used the color 'darkgoldenrod' which complements the main image on the homepage and reflects the idea of a luxury range.
