##Motivation
After being furloughed during the pandemic, a friend of mine, Rebecca Latimer, has begun importing and selling eco-friendly belts produced by her brother's company in Italy:  
[tie-ups Italian site](https://www.tie-ups.it/?v=1471e3d26b3e)
As the company site is in Italian only and includes merchandise not stocked by my friend, to help her promote the products I offered to create a  different website for her for the UK market that focused on her key ranges of accessories.

##Branding and Header
I retained the white text on a blackground of the original site header for maximum contrast.  I created a new logo using the MuseoModerno font from Google Fonts and the ribbon icon from Font Awesome.
To indicate the active page and clickable links throughout the site I used the color 'darkgoldenrod' which complements the main image on the homepage and reflects the idea of a luxury range.
Media queries were added to the header section to prevent elements overlapping. 

##Home Page
I wanted to maximize the visual impact on the user by including a couple of striking images of the belts themselves.
The photographs were taken by a professional photographer Tony Cullinane [Tony Cullinane Photography - Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TonyCullinanePhotography) 
The text reprents the company ethos of producing sustainable, cruelty free, stylish Italian accessories.

##Footer
To prevent overlapping on smaller devices I added a media query change the display of the company logo to 'none' so that only the clickable social media links are visible.
The links currently take the user to the Facebook and Instagram home pages. These will be amended to link directly to my friend's social media accounts in the future.

##Products Page
All product images were provided by the Italian tie-ups company.
I originally intended to use media queries to amend the number of products displayed horizontally from 3 to 2 to 1 according to the device width.  As I was struggling with items overlapping and finding the right breakpoints, I decided to research slack for some other suggestions and found the following post very helpful [Igor CSS Grid Post on Slack](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C0L316Z96/p1620317611161800). This also led me on to the following flexbox tutorial on youtube[webdev Simplified Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE).
Through Flexbox I managed to resize the images responsively and I applied the same technique to stack images on top of text on smaller screens for the home page and the contacts page.  I found the following documentation very helpful to refer to [Mdn Flexbox Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) 
Currently 18 products are listed. More will be added as Rebecca's stock expands.


##Contacts Page
 My friend rents an area of Wratten's Gift Shop in Chislehurst from which she sells the belts. The map image was taken from Google Maps using a snipping tool.

##Future Development Possibilities
Back end development that links the form to a client database
Possibility of purchasing items online
